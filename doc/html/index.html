Eagle Mode is an advanced solution for a futuristic style of man-machine
communication, in which the user can visit almost everything simply by zooming
in. It has a professional file manager, file viewers and players for most of the
common file types, a chess game, a 3D mines game, a multi-function clock and
some fractal fun, all integrated in a virtual cosmos. Besides, that cosmos
also provides a Linux kernel configurator in form of a kernel patch.
