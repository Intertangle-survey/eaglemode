Eagle Mode is an advanced solution for a futuristic style of man-machine
communication, in which the user can visit almost everything simply by zooming
in. It has a professional file manager, file viewers and players for most of the
common file types, a chess game, a 3D mines game, a multi-function clock and
some fractal fun, all integrated in a virtual cosmos. By featuring a separate
popup-zoomed control view, help texts in the things they are describing,
editable bookmarks, multiple input methods, fast anti-aliased graphics, a
virtually unlimited depth of panel tree, and by its portable C++ API, Eagle Mode
aims to be a cutting edge of zoomable user interfaces.
